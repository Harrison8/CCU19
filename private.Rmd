The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is a federal law enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Under the CRA, banks with assets of over $1.221 billion must report detailed small business loan data.^2 In 2017, approximately 90% of outstanding small business loans were held at banks that met the threshold for mandatory reporting.^3 Many smaller institutions also choose to report this data.^2 While some small lenders are not included, our conclusions are based on a data set that captures a large majority of small business lending from banks.
