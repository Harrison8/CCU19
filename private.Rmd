# Bank Loans to Small Business

The largest lending channel for small business is through banks. The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities. Under the CRA, banks must report their lending to small businesses.

Since the early 2000's, bank loans have decreased in Louisville in line with its peer cities. Over the past few years, Louisville has seen a moderate amount of small business lending compared to its peer cities.

# Federally-Supported SBA Loans

The U.S. Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program helps small business access credit by guaranteeing the repayment of most of the loa amount to the lender. These federal funds help small businesses by providing them easier, cheaper access to credit, and they help lenders by helping them recoup their losses in the case of a default.

While Louisville used to rank toward the top of its peers in SBA 7(a) loans, its has not increased the amount of 7(a) loans at the same pase as its peers. In 2019, Louisville ranked 16th in the total dollar amount of SBA 7(a) loans in the community.
